# somepany-database

1. Data Modeling
Drawing from a number of employee data files, I sketched out an ERD to layout the framework of a SQL database.

2. Data Engineering
According to this design, I created a schema inclusing specification of data types and keys.

3. Data Analysis
The query file makes a number of SQL queries, while the bonus file uses SQLAlchemy to import the database into Pandas dataframe and visualize information about average salary and range.
